# CSE742
This project was done as a project requirement of Evalutionary Computing-CSC742

In this project, we used a textual dataset where we applied both upervised learning and unsupervised learning algorithms to build a relationship betweene words and lemmas. For supervised learning, we used decision trees. On the other hand, we used Spectral Clustering, Agglomerative Clustering, and Affinity
Propagation. Initally, we tested these algorithms with randomly chosen hyperparameters of these algorims. Then we applied Genetic Algorithm. We applied both mutation and cross-over to get better results over generation. Finnaly, we got have showed the performance of different algorithms.
